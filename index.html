        <p>The Community Work Centre induction continues to build on what has been discussed at
          the initial assessment and provides another opportunity to demonstrate manaakitanga and establish
          the requirements and expectations of the sentence. It is important to clearly establish the working
          relationship with the community worker and set the reporting frequency to ensure the sentence is
          successfully completed.</p>

          <ul>

            <li>Complete the Community Work Centre Induction, including the CW Centre Induction Confirmation Form.</li>
            <li>Establish a reporting regime and issue an instruction to report that will meet the requirement of completing
              100 hours within a 6 month timeframe.
              Standard of Practice: Schedule contact – an instruction to report is in IOMS</li>

          <h3>Establishing a Reporting Regime</h3>
          <p>Where possible, we should ensure a person can successfully complete their hours while also maintaining their employment
            and family responsibilities. It is important to balance the needs of the community worker and what is available and practical
            within your operational constraints. Much of this information will be contained within the Community Work Placement Assessment
            and WLS Suitability form.</p></br>
            <p>There will be some situations where this is a challenge and will require some negotiation with the community worker. If they are unwilling to commit
              to an instruction to report that will ensure they meet the legislative requirements of their sentence, you should consider an application to cancel
              the sentence. </p></br>
          <h4>Considerations</h4>
          <h5>Sentence and risk factors:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Are there alerts or other risk indicators to be considered? (eg gang affiliation, non-associations or co-offenders completing
              community work)</li>
              <li>Do they have a concerning previous offending history? (take particular note of previous violence or sexual offending)</li>
              <li>How long is the current sentence? What hours are available to ensure completion within the maximum completion timeframe?</li>
              <li>Do they want to complete hours quickly?</li>
            </ul>
          <h5>Personal factors:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Are they young and / or vulnerable (physical / mental / intellectual needs, gender needs, language barriers or victim of offending)?
                How can we ensure their safety during community work?</li>
              <li>Do they have skill sets that link to specific projects being completed?</li>
            </ul>
          <h5>Availability factors</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Do they have employment or family / whanau responsibilities that will limit their availability to complete hours? </li>
              <li>Are there cultural or religions factors that need to be considered? language</li>
              <li>Do they require transport support to attend community work?</li>
              <li>Are they on the methadone programme?</li>
            </ul>
